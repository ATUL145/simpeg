Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics  -  A python package for simulation and gradient based parameter estimation in the context of geophysical applications.

The vision is to create a package for finite volume simulation with applications to geophysical imaging and subsurface flow. To enable the understanding of the many different components, this package has the following features:

* modular with respect to the spacial discretization, optimization routine, and geophysical problem
* built with the inverse problem in mind
* provides a framework for geophysical and hydrogeologic problems
* supports 1D, 2D and 3D problems
* designed for large-scale inversions
